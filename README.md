# Phase-1_Project
OVERVIEW

This project provides an analysis of aviation data and outlines key recommendations that are necessary for the strategic growth and expansion of our company into the aviation industry. This analysis majorly focuses on aircraft engine type, make, number of Engines, and incident severity, to enhance safety and risk management and aircraft maintenance. 

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING 

•	What are the Key Factors to consider when choosing the Aircraft for purchase for the company?
•	What are measures of risk management should we be keen on when venturing into the aviation industry
•	What are the best ways of diversifying our business?

DATA UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS

	Source of data

In this project I made use of aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (1962–2023), we will analyze risks, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations.
The Aviation data used for this analysis can be accessed using the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses

	Description of data

The data used for this analysis has 31 columns and 88889 rows. I conducted data cleaning on the data and remained with 20 columns and 46912 rows.

DATA VISUALIZATIONS 

1)	Bar Graph
	
The graph below will help us establish which  aircraft manufacturers have the highest number of incidents, specific models are involved most frequently and in making a trend analysis of whether certain manufacturers or models are more prone to incidents.

2)	Scatter Plot
   
This scatter plot will help us establish if the number of engines  correlate with the severity of injuries in an incident and if single-engine aircraft are involved in more severe incidents with comparison to multi-engine aircraft.

3)	Line Chart
4)	
The below line chart examines Aviation incidents over time 
This will help us establish if aviation incidents increasing or decreasing over time, if there specific years with a spike or drop in incidents and we identify long-term safety trends in aviation

EVALUATION

1.	Trend in the occurrence of Incidents

a.	The data analysis identifies aircraft models that have experienced many incidents, suggesting safety issues. 
b.	Compared to aircraft with several engines, single-engine aircraft exhibit a higher frequency of incident occurrences.

2.	Patterns of Injury

a.	From the analysis done the number of minor injuries correlates with the number of engines, therefore, there is a need for improved safety mechanisms in aircraft with several engines.
b.	Some aircraft types consistently report higher injury rates, requiring additional review of safety standards.

3.	Adverse Weather Conditions

a.	Poor weather conditions significantly impact incident rates, hence the importance of weather preparedness in aviation safety measures.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

(I)	Examine occurrence patterns to raise the bar for aviation safety, paying particular attention to high-risk models and manufactures.

(II)	To better prepare pilots for managing emergency scenarios and a range of weather conditions, implement customized training programs.

(III)	To lower mechanical failures and mishaps, promote the use of safer aircraft types and make sure they receive routine maintenance.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the aviation sector can lower incident rates, increase pilot preparedness, and improve overall flight safety by addressing these critical areas. For long-term gains, proactive safety measures and ongoing data analysis will be essential.
